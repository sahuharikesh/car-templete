                <button class="accordion">For how long can I subscribe a car?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>You can subscribe to a car for 6, 12, 24 or 36 months depending on your need. The longer you subscribe, the lesser is your monthly Subscription Fee.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Which cars can I subscribe to? What are the variants?</button>
                <div class="panel">
            <p>ZAP Subscribe currently offers multiple car models in all Zoomcar cities. Check the car variants available in your city here.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Can I buy the car I have subscribed to?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>While we would have loved to give you the option if you wanted, our arrangement with OEMs and financiers would
                       make this a very expensive option for you. You can always subscribe to a car though :)</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Do I get to chose the color of the car as well?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Unfortunately, No. :( We know you want your car as soon as possible, hence, we have limited control over the color of the car.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Will the cars be fitted with speed governors?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>The car would be registered under Zoomcar's Self Drive Car Rental license, which makes it commercial in nature.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Will the car have black-board registration?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>he car would be registered under Zoomcar's Self Drive Car Rental license making it a black board car.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Can I extend my tenure?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Tenure can be extended anytime during the subscription period. Given the huge demand for this product, we suggest you do
                      this at least a month before the scheduled end date of the subscription as the extension is subject to availability of the car.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>We wish you drive safe and never have to go through this! However, in that unfortunate event, just call our AEC
                       Support [contact details will be available in the ZAP App] and we will take it from there.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Do I need to be GST registered?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                 <p>While this is not mandatory, we do recommend you get a GST registration. Don’t worry, we have this very easy for you. Our GST
                      partners will reach out to you and get the process started. It’s a very simple process and takes around 7 days to get a GSTIN.</p>
